# Java-Currency-Converter

This is a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) Application to convert currency.


## Background
Having some friends from abroad, sometimes I need to convert different currencies. Inspired by Windows Currency Calculator, I decided to make a currency converter to further develop my Java skill. This application uses Java FX Framework to display Graphical User Interface. The conversion data is obtained from ExchangeRate-API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) by converting the JSON from the API to Plain Old Java Object (POJO).


## Functionalities
1. Convert Currency: User is able to convert currency from another currency. 

2. Check Conversion: User is able to check the conversion of different currencies.
