# Java-Currency-Converter

This is a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) Application to convert currency.


## Background
Having some friends from abroad, I often need to convert different currencies. Inspired by Windows Currency Calculator, I decided to develop a currency converter to enhance my Java skills. This application uses Java FX Framework to display Graphical User Interface. The conversion data is obtained from ExchangeRate-API (https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) by parsing the JSON response from the API into Plain Old Java Object (POJO).


## Functionalities
1. Currency Conversion: Users can convert currency from one to another. 

2. Currency Rate Check: Users can check the conversion rate between different currencies.
